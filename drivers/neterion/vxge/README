=== Introduction ===
Linux Driver for Neterion Inc's X3100 Series 10GbE PCIe I/O Virtualized Server Adapter

 * Supports Neterion Inc's X3100 Series 10GbE adapters for 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels. 
 * Supports several features such as jumbo frames, MSI-X, checksum offloads, TSO, LRO, single function, multi function, SRIOV, MRIOV, Function level bandwidth and priority configuration.

(See below for complete list of features supported for both IPv4 and IPv6)

=== Installation Instructions ===

For 2.6 kernel make sure you have installed the Linux kernel source rpm.  
To verify whether you have kernel source directories inside
/usr/src do "find /usr/src|grep <kernel Version>".  
     Use "uname -r" to get kernel version.

For 2.4 kernels make sure there is a symbolic link file named
"/usr/src/linux-2.4" pointing to the correct kernel source directory. 
Run "ls -l" and verify whether "/usr/src/linux-2.4" is pointing to the
correct directory. If it is pointing to the wrong directory, please delete
the link and create a new file with command:
     # ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.4.xxxx /usr/src/linux-2.4

                3                3 (lowest)      Remaining  

     The driver parameter settings will be -   
     #vmkload_mod vxge max_config_dev=3 rx_bw=1000,2000 priority=0,3,3   

=== Performance Suggestions ===

1. Set MTU to maximum - 9000 for switch setup, 9600 for back-to-back.

2. Set TCP windows size to optimal value. 
     For example
       For MTU=1500, TCP window size of 210K is recommended:
	 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="210000 210000 210000"
	 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="210000 210000 210000"

       or apply sysctl.conf file from driver package
         # sysctl -p sysctl_neterion_1500.conf

       For MTU=9000, TCP window size of 10 MB is recommended:
	 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="10000000 10000000 10000000"
	 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="10000000 10000000 10000000"

       or apply sysctl.conf file from driver package
         # sysctl -p sysctl_neterion_9000.conf

''Transmit performance''

   Ensure Transmit Checksum offload and TSO are enabled. 
   Use ethtool to verify/set these parameters.

     # ethtool -k eth#
     Offload parameters for eth0:
     rx-checksumming: on
     tx-checksumming: on
     scatter-gather: on
     tcp segmentation offload: off

   Turn on Transmit Checksum offload and TSO:
     # ethtool -K eth# tx on
     # ethtool -K eth# tso on (for 2.6 kernels)

''Receive performance''

1. Ensure Receive Checksum offload is enabled. Use ethtool to verify/set.
     # ethtool -k eth#
     # ethtool -K eth# rx on

2. If MTU is set to 1500, receive performance can be improved by increasing
   the default TCP window size and enabling LRO (see "Configurable driver
   parameters" section). 
     # sysctl -p sysctl_neterion_1500.conf

3. Enable NAPI to bring down CPU utilization.

''Troubleshooting''

For X3100 adapter assigned eth2

Statistics Dump:
     # ethtool –S eth2 

Register Dump:
     # ethtool –d eth2

''Before Contacting Neterion for Support...''

statistical information.  The latest version of Ethtool is available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/

     ethtool eth#
       Displays current device settings

     ethtool -a eth#
       Displays pause parameter information.

     ethtool -A eth#
       Changes pause parameters.

     ethtool -d eth#
       Retrieves and prints a register dump for the specified ethernet device.

      ethtool -g ethx
       Queries the specified ethernet device for rx/tx ring parameter information.

     ethtool -i eth#
       Displays device driver information

     ethtool -k eth#
       Displays offload parameters information.

     ethtool -K eth# [rx on|off] [tx on|off] [sg on|off] [tso on|off]

     ethtool -p eth# [N]
       Initiates adapter-specific action intended to enable an operator to
       easily identify the physical adapter by sight.  Typically this involves
       blinking one or more LEDs on the specified ethernet port.

         N - Length of time to perform phys-id, in seconds.

     ethtool -S eth#
       Displays adapter and driver statistics.

     ethtool -t eth# [offline|online]
       Executes adapter selftest on the specified ethernet device. Possible
       test modes are:

         offline (default) - performs full set of tests, possibly interrupting
           normal adapter operation during the tests.
         online - performs limited set of tests, not interrupting normal
           adapter operation.

=== Known Issues ===

TSO disabled in SUSE 9:
     TSO is disabled by default in SuSE 9. It may be manually enabled 
     using the ethtool command.
       # ethtool -K eth# tso on

''Common Problems''

Symbolic link:
     Before debugging any compilation related problems, ensure that the    
     following symbolic link/directory points to the correct kernel source
     tree.    
       For 2.4, /usr/src/linux-2.4
       For 2.6, /usr/src/linux-2.6

Version Mismatch:
     One of the common problems encountered on trying to load the driver is
     related to a version mismatch between current kernel and the kernel for
     which the driver was built. Typical error message is as follows:

     Using /lib/modules/2.x.y-SMP/kernel/drivers/net/vxge.o 
     /lib/modules/2.x.y-SMP/kernel/drivers/net/vxge.o: kernel-module               
     version mismatch /lib/modules/2.x.y-SMP/kernel/drivers/net/vxge.o 
     was compiled for kernel version 2.x.y while this kernel is version 
     2.x.y-SMP. 

     To fix this problem, ensure the kernel is enabled for SMP by following
     these steps:

     1.  Go to the directory where kernel sources are located.
	  (e.g. /usr/src/linux-2.4.19.SuSE) 

     2. Execute "make menuconfig". This will bring up the "Linux
          Kernel Configuration" menu. Select "Processor type and features".
	  Ensure that "Symmetric multi-processing support" is enabled.
	  Save this configuration and exit.

     3. This will compile the kernel with SMP support. 

=== Available Downloads ===

   For latest available Neterion drivers or further support please contact your 
   network adapter provider or check the Neterion support download site at

   This readme applies to the Neterion Linux driver available from our website.
   Although the Neterion Linux drivers are included in the mainline kernel and 
   major Linux distribution09(i.e. Red Hat, Suse, etc), and are similar, each 
   distribution accepts or rejects our driver changes at their own discretion.  
   Therefore, some features may be enabled or disabled in different releases.
